# Democracy Layers

## What This Is

Systematic analysis of how democratic systems can evolve to meet modern challenges. Each layer examines a different aspect of governance, digging from surface assumptions down to foundational principles.

## The 11 Layers

1. **Foundation** - Scarcity vs abundance in democratic participation
2. **Representation** - Direct participation vs proxy systems
3. **Aggregation** - How preferences get collected and processed
4. **Verification** - Transparency and accountability in democratic processes
5. **Economic Interface** - How democracy interacts with economic systems
6. **Implementation** - How democratic decisions get executed
7. **Conflict Resolution** - How disputes and appeals get handled
8. **Information Systems** - How people develop capacity for participation
9. **Security** - How democratic systems protect themselves
10. **Scale Coordination** - How governance works across different levels
11. **Crisis Management** - How democracy adapts during emergencies

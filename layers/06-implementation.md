# Layer 6: Implementation - The Gap Between Decision and Reality

## The Core Question
Why do democratic decisions often look completely different by the time they're actually implemented?

## Surface Level
"Implementation requires expertise and bureaucracy. Laws need to be translated into specific procedures. Agencies have technical knowledge to carry out decisions effectively. Some adjustment is normal."

## Deeper Analysis
Implementation gaps allow democratic decisions to be quietly altered. Bureaucratic complexity creates multiple points where outcomes get redirected to serve institutional interests rather than democratic intent.

## Deeper Still
Implementation systems are designed to exhaust democratic energy. By the time policy winds through bureaucratic processes, the political momentum has dissipated and citizens can't track what actually happened.

## Even Deeper
We accept implementation distance because tracking outcomes is harder than making decisions. It's easier to vote and assume someone else handles details than verify democratic will actually gets executed.

## Bedrock
Implementation systems protect institutional operations from democratic interference. The gap between decision and execution processes democratic choices into forms that don't threaten existing arrangements.

## What Becomes Possible
Real-time tracking systems that connect democratic decisions directly to implementation outcomes.

## Questions
- How do we eliminate the gap between democratic decision and execution?
- What would governance look like with real-time implementation tracking?

## Contribute
How else does implementation distance protect existing systems from democratic change?

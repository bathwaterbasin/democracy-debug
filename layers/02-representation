# Layer 2: Representation - The Expertise Paradox

## The Core Question
If representatives were supposed to be better informed than voters, why do citizens with internet access often know more about policy details than their representatives?

## Surface Level
"Representatives are elected because they can focus full-time on understanding complex issues. They have staff, access to experts, and time to study legislation. Regular citizens are too busy with their own lives to become informed enough to make good policy decisions."

## Deeper Analysis
"Informed" is a control mechanism. Who decides what counts as being informed? The same institutions that benefit from limiting participation. "You need to understand the complexity" really means "you need to accept our framing of the problem."

## Deeper Still
Information gets weaponized when it's filtered through gatekeepers who decide what's "credible" or "relevant." In a disinformation environment, being "more informed" often just means you've consumed more sophisticated propaganda. The "informed citizen" becomes whoever has been most successfully programmed by credentialed sources.

## Even Deeper
The real problem isn't that people are uninformed - it's that "being informed" as a prerequisite for participation is just another scarcity gate. Why should democratic participation require passing someone else's information literacy test?

## Bedrock
Expertise requirements for participation exist to exclude people, not to improve decisions. The representation system uses "complexity" as justification for removing decision-making power from the people most affected by those decisions.

## Technical Solution Needed
Systems that enable direct participation while providing contextual information and expert input without requiring gatekeeping.

## Questions for Further Analysis
- How do we distinguish between genuine expertise and credentialed gatekeeping?
- What would governance look like if everyone could access the same information as representatives?
- How do we prevent direct democracy from being manipulated by disinformation?

## Contribute
What's deeper than this analysis? How else does the representation system exclude people under the guise of expertise?

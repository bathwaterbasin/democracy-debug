# Layer 7: Conflict Resolution - When Democracy Disagrees With Itself

## The Core Question
Why do legal systems routinely override democratic decisions when courts are supposed to interpret law, not make it?

## Surface Level
"Courts protect constitutional rights and rule of law. Judges interpret legislation and ensure democratic decisions don't violate fundamental principles. Legal systems provide neutral arbitration of disputes."

## Deeper Analysis
Legal systems operate by different rules than democratic systems, often overriding popular will. "Rule of law" becomes rule by lawyers who interpret democratic intentions through elite frameworks that most citizens never agreed to.

## Deeper Still
Conflict resolution systems are captured by the same interests that democratic systems are supposed to constrain. Legal complexity creates another layer where democratic energy gets redirected into forms that serve institutional preservation.

## Even Deeper
We accept legal override of democratic decisions because we don't trust democracy to handle complex conflicts. We'd rather have expert arbitrators than risk popular decisions we might not like.

## Bedrock
Legal systems exist to protect existing arrangements from democratic challenge. Conflict resolution becomes a way to process democratic pressure into outcomes that don't threaten established power relationships.

## What Becomes Possible
Transparent arbitration systems where conflict resolution serves democratic legitimacy rather than institutional stability.

## Questions
- How do we resolve conflicts without overriding democratic input?
- What would justice look like if it served democratic principles rather than legal precedent?

## Contribute
How else do conflict resolution systems redirect democratic energy away from challenging existing arrangements?

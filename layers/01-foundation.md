# Layer 1: Foundation - Democratic Scarcity vs Abundance

## The Core Question
Why is democratic participation treated as a limited resource when technology enables unlimited participation?

## Surface Level
"We need representatives because direct democracy doesn't scale. With millions of people, we can't have everyone voting on every issue. Representatives are better informed and can focus full-time on governance."

## Deeper Analysis
Information scarcity was artificial even in 1776. Town halls worked fine for local decisions. The "we need representatives because people can't know enough" was an excuse to concentrate power, not solve a real information problem.

## Deeper Still
Representatives were designed to filter and control popular will, not amplify it. The Founders could have designed more participatory systems but deliberately chose to limit democratic input. They wanted to prevent "mob rule" - meaning they wanted to prevent actual popular sovereignty.

## Even Deeper
Democratic scarcity creates the conditions where economic extraction becomes possible. Limited participation means most people can't effectively challenge policies that benefit concentrated interests. The scarcity isn't a bug, it's a feature.

## Bedrock
Democracy was designed to be limited from the beginning because unlimited democracy threatens any form of hierarchical control. The representative system exists to maintain controllable distance between popular will and actual power.

## Technical Solution Needed
Systems that enable abundant democratic participation while maintaining quality decision-making and preventing manipulation.

## Questions for Further Analysis
- How much direct participation can modern systems actually handle?
- What would governance look like with true abundance of democratic input?
- How do we prevent abundant democracy from becoming chaotic democracy?

What's deeper than this bedrock? What are we missing about the foundation layer?

# Layer 3: Aggregation - The Trust Problem

## The Core Question
Why do we force complex human preferences into binary yes/no choices when we have technology that could capture nuanced positions?

## Surface Level
"Complex issues need to be simplified for voting. You can't have a thousand different options on a ballot. Democracy requires clear choices between alternatives. Binary voting is simple, understandable, and produces decisive results."

## Deeper Analysis
Binary choices collapse nuanced preferences artificially. Real human preferences are multidimensional and contextual. "Yes/no on this 500-page bill" isn't how humans actually think about problems. We need preference mapping, not forced simplification.

## Deeper Still
Forced simplification serves those who benefit from crude policy. When you can only choose between two predetermined options, whoever controls what those options are controls the outcome. The complexity gets front-loaded into option creation (controlled by elites) while choice gets artificially simplified.

## Even Deeper
We force binary choices because we don't trust people to handle complexity, and we don't trust systems to aggregate complexity fairly. The simplification isn't about technical limitations - it's about trust limitations.

## Bedrock
Binary aggregation exists because we're afraid of what democracy would look like if we actually trusted it. We've never tried true preference aggregation at scale, so we don't know what would happen if people could express exactly what they want. The binary system protects us from discovering what genuine democratic will actually looks like.

## Technical Solution Needed
Multi-dimensional preference capture systems that can handle complexity and unknown outcomes without predetermined constraints.

## Questions for Further Analysis
- What are we afraid will happen if people can express full preferences?
- How do we build systems that can handle unknown democratic outcomes?
- What would policy look like if it reflected actual preference distributions rather than forced choices?

## Contribute
What's beneath this bedrock? What else are we afraid to trust about democratic expression?

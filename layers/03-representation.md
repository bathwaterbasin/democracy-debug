# Layer 3: Aggregation - The Preference Collapse

## The Core Question
Why do we force complex human preferences into binary yes/no choices when we have technology that could capture nuanced positions?

## Surface Level
"Complex issues need to be simplified for voting. You can't have a thousand different options on a ballot. Democracy requires clear choices between alternatives. Binary voting is simple, understandable, and produces decisive results."

## Deeper Analysis
Binary choices collapse nuanced preferences artificially. Real human preferences are multidimensional and contextual. "Yes/no on this 500-page bill" isn't how humans actually think about problems. We need preference mapping, not forced simplification.

## Deeper Still
Forced simplification serves those who benefit from crude policy. When you can only choose between two predetermined options, whoever controls what those options are controls the outcome. Binary aggregation manufactures consent for decisions that don't reflect actual popular preferences.

## Even Deeper
Current aggregation systems are designed to make meaningful choice impossible. The complexity gets front-loaded into the option creation process (controlled by elites), while the choice process gets artificially simplified (to create illusion of democratic input).

## Bedrock
Aggregation systems are designed to manufacture consent for predetermined outcomes, not discover genuine popular will. Binary voting exists to limit democratic expression to choices that don't threaten existing power arrangements.

## Technical Solution Needed
Multi-dimensional preference capture systems that can handle complexity while producing actionable decisions.

## Questions for Further Analysis
- How do we aggregate complex preferences without creating paralysis?
- What would policy look like if it reflected actual popular preference distributions?
- How do we prevent complex aggregation from being gamed by sophisticated actors?

## Contribute
What's beneath this bedrock? How else does binary aggregation distort democratic will?

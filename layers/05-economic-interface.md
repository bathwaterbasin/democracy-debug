# Layer 5: Economic Interface - The Elephant in the Room

## The Core Question
Why do economic pressures routinely override democratic decisions when democracy is supposed to be how we make collective choices?

## Surface Level
"Democracy handles political decisions, markets handle economic decisions. Sometimes they conflict and we need to balance democratic will with economic reality. Markets are more efficient at resource allocation."

## Deeper Analysis
Economic power overrides democratic decisions through lobbying, regulatory capture, and capital flight threats. "Economic reality" often just means the preferences of concentrated wealth.

## Deeper Still
Current economic arrangements require limited democratic participation to survive. If people could effectively organize their collective preferences, most wealth distribution patterns would be unsustainable.

## Even Deeper
We don't examine how democracy and economics interact because it would force us to choose between them. We pretend they're compatible when they're often directly opposed.

## Bedrock
We maintain the separation between "political" and "economic" decisions because acknowledging their integration would reveal that economic power has already determined most of our democratic options.

## What Becomes Possible
Systems that integrate democratic decision-making with economic reality without subordinating one to the other.

## Questions
- What would an economy look like that actually served democratic decisions?
- Can democratic and economic power be balanced, or does one always dominate?

## Contribute
How else do economic and democratic systems limit each other?

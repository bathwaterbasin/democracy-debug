# Democracy Debug

*"Democracy needs updates. We're the tailors. Bring your governance, we'll tailor it for the times."*

## What This Is

I'm running against my childhood friend Mike for US Senate in North Carolina while endorsing him. I knew Mike as kids in Michigan. We both ended up in North Carolina with our families. He's become exactly the kind of leader this state develops. I'm running to make sure our political conversation is worthy of the moment we're actually facing.

Mike represents the best of current democratic institutions. I'm exploring what comes after those institutions evolve.

Here are frameworks for the next version of American democracy - built with transparency, powered by technology, designed for the challenges our kids will inherit.

## The Challenge

**11 Layers of Democratic Evolution** - how governance systems can grow to meet modern complexity

**Technical Solutions** - RFCs for implementing each upgrade with today's tools

**Open Development** - collaborative design for better democracy

## For Mike (and every candidate)

The biggest questions facing any Senator aren't partisan - they're systemic. How do we govern at the speed of modern problems? How do we make democracy work for people who've lost faith in institutions?

These frameworks are offered in friendship and respect. Use what helps, ignore what doesn't, build something better.
